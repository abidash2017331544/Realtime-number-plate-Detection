# Realtime-number-plate-Detection
<p>Hello. This project is a basic idea for automatic number plate detection system using easyocr and python. It is done with Jupyter notebook. If u do not know, how to run that or bring that, you need to go to your cmd and install it. then just use jupyter notebook in the cmd. it will open in a browser. then u can open the file project.ipynb. all the needed commands line are given there. I am again telling u, that may not be the best but its a basic project to learn and understand ANPRS. Hope you like it.

## Steps
<br />
<b>Step 1.</b> Clone this repository: [https://github.com/abidash2017331544/Realtime-number-plate-Detection.git]
<br/><br/>
<b>Step 2.</b> Create a new virtual environment 
<pre>
python -m venv anprsys
</pre> 
<br/>
<b>Step 3.</b> Activate your virtual environment
<pre>
.\anprsys\Scripts\activate # Windows 
</pre>
<br/>
<b>Step 4.</b> Install dependencies and add virtual environment to the Python Kernel
<pre>
pip install ipykernel
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
jupyter notebook
</pre>
<br/>
<b>Step 5.</b> in the jupyter Notebook  - ensure you change the kernel to the virtual environment as shown below

<br/>
<b>Step 6. </b> Begin training process by opening <a href="https://github.com/nicknochnack/TFODCourse/blob/main/2.%20Training%20and%20Detection.ipynb">2. Training and Detection.ipynb</a>, this notebook will walk you through installing Tensorflow Object Detection, making detections, saving and exporting your model. 
<br /><br/>
<b>Step 7.</b> During this process the Notebook will install Tensorflow Object Detection. You should ideally receive a notification indicating that the API has installed successfully at Step 8 with the last line stating OK.
<br /> <br/>
<b>Step 8.</b> Once you get to step 6. Train the model, inside of the notebook.
